## Introduction
You are trapped inside a room and your only way out is to solve a riddle. There is a door through which you have to escape. This door is opened by a switch which is placed on the floor and is activated by a certain amount of weight. You can stand on the switch and the door opens, but if you want to leave through the door, the door closes itself right in front of your face. You have to find a way to keep the door open. The solution to this is as follows: You have to walk up the stairs, grab a chair and place it on a switch on the floor. Afterwards, the door keeps open and you can escape.    
During the play through, there is the theme song of the andy griffith show playing in the background.    
Because the Engine is rather hard to learn, I solved many things over the UI or using Blueprints instead of coding it myself. 
## Technical aspects
A little project with Unreal Engine 4 and C++.
